## Notes About My Process

I have never worked with aurelia prior to starting this project. Mainly, my front end experience has been with react. I know that you guys use aurelia so I wanted to dive in and do my coding challenge in it. Obviously this may mean I'm not putting my best foot forward in terms of showing you how I can work with a framework I'm experienced in. I had a few thins I couldn't figure out in the timeframe, like how to move or store data and pass it between components so I had to call the endpoint from each component, and the navbar is static not dynamic cause I wasn't super familiar with routes, I left some boilerplate code in it because I wasn't quite sure if it was needed, or a few things likes that where I was just unfamiliar with the framework. However, I hope it does show initative and that I can jump into an unfamiliar framework and get going right away. Thank you for your time reviewing this!
